# UNDISSOLVED — Snapshots of a fast-fashion life

**UNDISSOLVED** is an interactive data visualization exploring fast fashion consumption through the lens of particle-based 3D storytelling. This segment of the project visualizes the average number of garments a person discards over a lifetime, using 3D meshes, particle transitions, and contextual overlays.

---

## 🧠 Data Approach

* Consumption estimates are based on global fast-fashion averages.
* Waste and material impact facts are drawn from publicly available studies on textile sustainability and microplastic emissions.

---

## 🛠️ Built With

* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
* [GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader)
* \[JavaScript + WebGL Particle Systems]
* Custom mesh + particle morphing logic

## 🙋‍♂️ About

This project is part of a series of self-initiated weekend explorations focused on **visual storytelling, environmental design, and AI-supported workflows**.

AI was used in:

* Research & data gathering
* 3D mesh generation
* Code structure & error fixing
